# Wanderlust-A-Social-Media-Application

The covid 19 pandemic significantly impacted the travel industry, leading to layoffs and impacting economies, livelihoods, public services and opportunities on all continents. All parts of its vast value chain have been affected. 

Covid 19 lockdown took a mental toll in each and everyone’s life. It brought a sense of fear and anxiety, leading to short-term and long-term psychosocial and mental health implications for children and adults. 

‘Revenge travel’: because the home was not where the heart is after months of anxiety, working from home, doing or conducting classes online, and being unable to meet even close relatives, people have masked up, got their jabs and wasted no time in heading outdoors. 

Post covid travels made people want to travel twice as much as they did previously, but with a lot of fear and restrictions. 

Here is ‘Wanderlust’ -a social media application where people post their experiences on post covid traveling, giving insights, details, and risks posed to traveling places.
